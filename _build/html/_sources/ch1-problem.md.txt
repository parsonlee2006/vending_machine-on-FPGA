# The problem 

## Motivation 

When I was in Taiwan, there were always a lot of choice for the night snack.
However, Most shops and super market will closed daily after the 8 p.m in Germany.
For that reason, It's not convenient for buying night snack in the middle of night.

To slove the problem, a intelligent vending machines coudl work not only 24/7 but also no manpower.

> (I want just to buy some snacks in the middle of the night and watch moive XD!)

Meanwhile, I am more interested in hardware design during my FPGA study. 
<!-- Through one semester's learning, projects and reference materials, joined with the innovation of programming language and circuit logic design, experience the execution, apply innovativeness and find the joy of creation -->

Conseqently, I want to use this final project to implement it and learn more about hardware design and logic design.
In the following paragrpahs, a intelligent vending machines circuit on FPGA will be presented.

## Procedure

This topic is mainly implemented on FPGA, so it is necessary to understand the specifications and operation methods of FPGA.
In addition, vending machine system architecture and sub-projects are also required to implement special topics.

Figure 1 shows the projects process, the steps are as follows:
